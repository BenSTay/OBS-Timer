Countdown Timer for OBS, based on [mikbe/OBS_Timer](https://github.com/mikbe/OBS_Timer).
Provides greater usability by allowing the user to select a specific end time for the countdown.

### Possible Improvements
* Ability to set a timer for a given timespan instead of counting down to a given datetime.
* UI Enhancements
